# ArtfulAbstraction

An Interactive rendering program for stylized rendering of images to abstract the details.

## Tools
“HTML”, “CSS” 
and “Javascript” using “WebGL 1.0” package. 

## Introduction

Most of the computer Graphics research has focused on photorealistic rendering and not much on artistic rendering.
 Artistic rendering can be achieved by controlling the color, 
shape, size of the brush strokes. In this paper I tried to replicate 
the ideas about abstract image representations from [Haeberli 
1990].
Although I did not get the exact same results as 
[Haeberli 1990], I followed and implemented some of the 
techniques described in the paper and achieved reasonable 
results with artistic elements.

## Conclusion 

There is a fast development in the field of artistic rendering 
due to its heavy use in films and media. A number of automatic 
tools were developed and were more accessible than ever. The 
availability of various categories of techniques makes it very 
easy for the user nowadays to influence the audience and 
effectively convey his ideas.
By developing this I was able to learn how to understand 
various techniques of abstraction that could be implemented and 
the abstraction levels that can be obtained by varying the 
technique. By developing this tool, i got better insight into how 
shaders work in programmable pipeline in computer graphics 
and how to do shader programming.
